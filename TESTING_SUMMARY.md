# Knowledge Base Testing Resources - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Overview

I've created a comprehensive testing suite for your Knowledge Base functionality that includes both **automated testing scripts** and **detailed manual test plans**. This ensures your production application works correctly across all core features.

---

## 📋 What We've Built

### 1. **Comprehensive Manual Test Plan** (`KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TEST_PLAN.md`)
- **60+ detailed test cases** across 8 categories
- Step-by-step instructions for each test
- Expected results for verification
- Troubleshooting guides
- Covers: Upload, Storage, Viewing, Download, Delete, Integration, Error Handling, Performance

### 2. **Automated Test Script** (`scripts/test-knowledge-base.js`)
- **ES6 module-compatible** script for quick validation
- Tests API endpoints, environment setup, and file upload simulation
- **Detailed reporting** with pass/fail status and recommendations
- **npm script integration**: `npm run test:knowledge-base`

### 3. **Fixed Configuration Issues**
- **netlify.toml**: Corrected targetPort from 8093 to 8084
- **Package.json**: Added test script for easy execution
- **ES Module support**: Updated test script for modern Node.js

## 🚀 How to Execute Tests

### **Step 1: Start Development Environment**
```bash
# In one terminal
netlify dev
```
This will:
- ✅ Start Vite dev server on port 8084
- ✅ Load environment variables (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, etc.)
- ✅ Start Netlify functions
- ✅ Enable API endpoints

### **Step 2: Run Automated Tests (Quick Validation)**
```bash
# In another terminal
npm run test:knowledge-base
```

**Expected Output When Working:**
```
✅ Environment Variable - VITE_SUPABASE_URL: PASSED Set
✅ Environment Variable - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: PASSED Set
✅ Environment Setup Complete: PASSED 2/2 variables set
✅ API Endpoint - Knowledge Items: PASSED Status: 200
✅ API Response Format: PASSED Valid array response
✅ API Endpoint - Categories: PASSED Status: 200
✅ Categories Available: PASSED Found 4 categories
✅ File Upload Simulation: PASSED Status: 200
✅ Upload Response Valid: PASSED Valid upload response

Total Tests: 8
Passed: 8
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%
```

### **Step 3: Execute Manual Test Cases**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:8084`
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Follow test cases in `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TEST_PLAN.md`
4. Start with **Test Case 1.1: Basic Text File Upload**

## 📁 Test Files Included

The automated script creates these test files in `temp-test-files/`:

### **test-text.txt**
```
This is a test text file.
It has multiple lines.
Testing Knowledge Base upload.
```

### **test-markdown.md**
```markdown
# Test Markdown

This is **bold** text.

- Item 1
- Item 2
```

### **test-data.json**
```json
{
  "test": "Knowledge Base Test",
  "type": "JSON",
  "data": { "success": true }
}
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Guide

### **If Automated Tests Fail:**

**Environment Variables Missing:**
```bash
# Check if netlify dev is running
ps aux | grep netlify

# Restart if needed
netlify dev
```

**Network Errors (fetch failed):**
```bash
# Check if port 8084 is accessible
curl http://localhost:8084/api/knowledge-base/items

# If 404, check netlify functions are loaded
netlify functions:list
```

**Upload 500 Errors:**
```bash
# Check netlify dev terminal for error logs
# Common issues:
# - Supabase connection problems
# - Database schema mismatches
# - Environment variable loading issues
```

### **If Manual Tests Fail:**

**Preview Shows "Not Available":**
- Check console logs for file data
- Verify `extracted_text` field has content
- Ensure file type is supported (txt, md, json)

**Download Fails:**
- Check browser network tab for errors
- Verify file ID exists in database
- Check if content is available
